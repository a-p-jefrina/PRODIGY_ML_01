## Introduction

<p align="justify">
Welcome to PRODIGY_ML_01, a comprehensive machine learning repository dedicated to predicting house prices using models based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. Whether you're a beginner looking to dive into practical machine learning applications or an experienced practitioner seeking streamlined implementations, this repository offers a wealth of resources, tutorials, and datasets to support your journey.
</p>

## Dataset Exploration and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

<p align="justify">
Before diving into model development, I conducted a thorough exploration of the dataset to gain insights into its characteristics and underlying patterns. This involved a series of crucial steps in exploratory data analysis (EDA):
</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li> **Data Distributions Analysis:** Examining the distributions of features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and house prices to understand their central tendencies, variability, and potential skewness.</li>
<li>**Outlier Identification and Treatment:** Identifying outliers that could significantly impact model performance and making informed decisions on whether to remove, transform, or retain them based on domain knowledge and statistical analysis.</li>
<li>**Handling Missing Values:** Addressing missing values in the dataset through techniques such as imputation, deletion, or using advanced algorithms to preserve data integrity while preparing it for modeling.</li>
<li>**Visualization of Key Trends:** Visualizing key trends and relationships between variables using plots and heatmap to uncover meaningful insights and correlations that guide feature selection and model design.</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">
The EDA process played a pivotal role in informing subsequent modeling decisions, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the dataset, and laying a solid foundation for the development of accurate and reliable machine learning models for house price prediction.
</p>

## Model Comparison

<p align="justify">
In this project, I implemented three distinct machine learning models, each selected based on its appropriateness for the task and its ability to capture underlying patterns in the data:
</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>**Linear Regression (LinearRegression):** Utilized for its simplicity and interpretability, linear regression served as a baseline model to establish a foundational understanding of the relationship between input features and house prices.</li>
<li>**Decision Tree Regression (DecisionTreeRegressor):** Decision trees were chosen for their capability to capture non-linear relationships and handle feature interactions effectively. This model was employed to explore more complex decision boundaries and potential splits within the dataset.</li>
<li>**Random Forest Regression (RandomForestRegressor):** Leveraging the power of ensemble learning, Random Forest Regression was adopted to harness the collective wisdom of multiple decision trees. Its ability to reduce overfitting while maintaining high predictive accuracy made it an ideal choice for modeling complex relationships in the data.</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">
Each model underwent training and evaluation, with performance metrics meticulously analyzed to assess their efficacy in predicting house prices accurately. By comparing the performance of these models, valuable insights were gained into their strengths, weaknesses, and suitability for the given task.
</p>

## Results

<p align="justify">
After a rigorous comparison, RandomForestRegressor emerged as the most accurate model for predicting prices. Its superior capability in capturing the underlying patterns in the dataset was evident from the performance metrics. After cross-validation, the calculated root mean square errors (RMSE) of 200 iterations were analyzed to determine the mean and standard deviation, further affirming its effectiveness. Consequently, RandomForestRegressor is selected as the final choice for price prediction in this project.
Future Steps
As my first machine learning project, there is always room for improvement. In the future, I plan to explore additional feature engineering techniques, experiment with more advanced models, and further optimize the selected model to enhance its predictive accuracy.

## Conclusion

<p align="justify">
In conclusion, this project marks my introduction to the field of machine learning. Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) and performing model comparisons have provided invaluable insights into the dataset, enabling the identification of a robust model for price prediction. This experience lays a solid foundation for future projects and fosters ongoing learning in the dynamic field of machine learning.
